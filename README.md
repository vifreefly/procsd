# Procsd

I do like the way how simple is managing of application processes in production on Heroku with [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile). How easily can be accessed application logs with [heroku logs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging) command. Just type `heroku create` and you're good to go.

Can we have something similar on the cheap Ubuntu VPS from DigitalOcean? Yes we can, all we need is a **systemd wrapper** which allows to export application processes from Procfile to system services, and control them/check status/access logs using simple commands.

> These days most of Linux distributions (including Ubuntu) has systemd as a default system processes manager. That's why it is a good idea to use systemd for managing application processes in production (for simple cases).

## Getting started

> **Note:** latest version of Procsd is `0.5.3`. Since version `0.4.0` there are some breaking changes. Check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). To update to the latest version, run `$ gem update procsd` or `$ bundle update procsd` (if you have already installed procsd).

> **Note:** Procsd works best with Capistrano integration: [vifreefly/capistrano-procsd](https://github.com/vifreefly/capistrano-procsd)

Install `procsd` first: `$ gem install procsd`. Required Ruby version is `>= 2.3.0`.

Let's say you have following application's Procfile:

```yaml
web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
worker: bundle exec sidekiq -e $RAILS_ENV
```
and you want to have one instance of web process && two instances of worker process. Create inside application directory `procsd.yml` config file:

```yaml
app: sample_app
formation: web=1,worker=2
environment:
  PORT: 2501
  RAILS_ENV: production
  RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: true
```

> The only required option in `procsd.yml` is `app` (application name). Also you can provide custom Systemd directory path (`systemd_dir` option, default is _/etc/systemd/system_)

Configuration is done.

### Create an application (export to Systemd)
> To disable and remove application from Systemd there is command `$ procsd destroy`.

```
deploy@server:~/sample_app$ procsd create

Value of the --user option: deploy
Value of the --dir option: /home/deploy/sample_app
Value of the --path option: /home/deploy/.rbenv/shims:/home/deploy/.rbenv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

Creating app units files in the systemd directory (/etc/systemd/system)...
Create: /etc/systemd/system/sample_app-web.1.service
Create: /etc/systemd/system/sample_app-worker.1.service
Create: /etc/systemd/system/sample_app-worker.2.service
Create: /etc/systemd/system/sample_app.target
Reloaded configuraion (daemon-reload)
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sample_app.target → /etc/systemd/system/sample_app.target.
Enabled app target sample_app.target
App services were created and enabled. Run `start` to start them

Note: add following line to the sudoers file (`$ sudo visudo`) if you don't want to type password each time for start/stop/restart commands:
deploy ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl start sample_app.target, /bin/systemctl stop sample_app.target, /bin/systemctl restart sample_app.target
```

You can provide additional options for `create` command:
* `--user` - name of the user, default is current _$USER_ env variable
* `--dir` - application's working directory, default is current _$PWD_ env variable
* `--path` - $PATH to include to the each service. Default is current _$PATH_ env variable
* `--add-to-sudoers` - if option present, procsd will create sudoers rule file `/etc/sudoers.d/app_name` which allow to start/stop/restart app services without a password prompt (passwordless sudo).
* `--or-restart` - if option provided and services already created, procsd will skip creation and call instead `restart` command. Otherwise (if services are not present), they will be created and (in additional) started. It's useful option for deployment tools like Capistrano, Mina, etc.


### Start application
> Other control commands: `stop` and `restart`

```
deploy@server:~/sample_app$ procsd start

Started app services (sample_app.target)
```


### Check the status
> You can filter processes, like `$ procsd status worker` (show status only for worker processes) or `$ procsd status worker.2` (show status only for worker.2 process)

> To show status of the main application target: `$ procsd status --target`

```

Systemd provides [a lot of possibilities](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs) to display and manage application logs (`journalctl` command). Procsd supports following options:
* `-n` - Specify how many last lines to print. Default is 100
* `-t` - Tail, display recent logs and leave the session open for real-time logs to stream in
* `--system` - Show only systemd messages about services (start/stop/restart/fail etc.)
* `--priority` - Filter messages by a [particular log level.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs#by-priority) For example show only error messages: `procsd logs --priority err`
* `--grep` - [Filter output](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journalctl.html#-g) to messages where message matches the provided query (may not work for [some](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1751006) Linux distributions)

### Execute processes defined in Procfile

Currently, procsd can not run all processes in development like `foreman start` does. But you can run one single process using `procsd exec` command:

```
deploy@server:~/sample_app$ procsd exec web

=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.2.1 application starting in production
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.12.0 (ruby 2.3.0-p0), codename: Llamas in Pajamas
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: production
* Listening on tcp://localhost:2501
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

`procsd exec` requres all the environment variables defined in `environment` section of `procsd.yml` config file.

Sometimes in development mode you need different environment configuration. For that you can add additional environment section `dev_environment` and require it as well using `--dev` flag, example:

```yaml
app: sample_app
environment:
  PORT: 2501
  RAILS_ENV: production
  RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: true
dev_environment:
  RAILS_ENV: development
  SOME_OTHER_DEV_ENV_VARIABLE: value
```

```
# Run web process with all environment & dev_environment variables included:

deploy@server:~/sample_app$ procsd exec web --dev
```

> In case if `dev_environment` has env variable with the same name like in `environment`, this variable will be rewritten with value from `dev_environment`.


### Nginx integration (with automatic HTTPS)
> Before make sure that you have Nginx installed `sudo apt install nginx` and running `sudo systemctl status nginx`.

If one of your application processes is a web process, you can automatically setup Nginx (reverse proxy) config for it. Why? For example to serve static files (assets, images, and all other files located in `public` folder or another customly defined folder) directly using fast Nginx, rather than application server. Or to enable SSL support (see below).

Add to your procsd.yml `nginx` section with `server_name` option defined:

> If you don't have a domain for an application (or don't need it), you can add server IP instead: `server_name: 159.159.159.159`.

> If your application use multiple domains/subdomains, add all of them separated with space: `server_name: my-domain.com us.my-domain.com uk.my-domain.com`

```yaml
app: sample_app
processes:
  web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
  worker: bundle exec sidekiq -e $RAILS_ENV
formation: web=1,worker=2
environment:
  PORT: 2501 # PORT will be used by Nginx to proxy requests from 0.0.0.0:80/443 to 127.0.0.1:PORT (required)
  HOST: localhost # Make sure that your application server in production running on 127.0.0.1, not 0.0.0.0
  RAILS_ENV: production
  RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: true
nginx:
  server_name: my-domain.com
  public_folder_path: public # path is relative to the main project directory, default value is `public`.
```

Configuration is done! Run [procsd create](#create-an-application-export-to-systemd) to create app services with Nginx reverse proxy config:

```
deploy@server:~/sample_app$ procsd create

Everything is done. Start app services (`procsd start`) and go to `http://my-domain.com` where you'll see your application proxying with Nginx.

#### Auto SSL using Certbot

To generate Nginx config with free SSL certificate (from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) included, you need to install [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) on the remote server first:

```bash
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install certbot python-certbot-nginx
```

> When you install certbot, it automatically setup a cron job (twice per day) to renew expiring certificates ([Automated Renewals](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#automated-renewals)), so you don't have to worry about renewing certificates manually.

Then update procsd.yml by adding `ssl: true`:

```yml
# ...
nginx:
  server_name: my-domain.com
  ssl: true # added
```

Configuration is done. **Make sure that all domains defined in procsd (nginx.server_name) are pointing to the server IP** where application is hosted. Then run `procsd create` _(you will probably need first run `procsd destroy` if app services already exists)_ as usual:

> By default Certbot obtaining certificate from _Let's Encrypt_ without a contact email. If you want to provide contact email, define env variable `CERTBOT_EMAIL` with your email in the `.env` file.

   Your cert will expire on 2019-02-17. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

That's it. Start app services (`procsd start`) and go to `https://my-domain.com` where you'll see your application proxying with Nginx and SSL enabled.

  <summary>Note about using Cloudflare CDN</summary><br>

If you use Cloudflare CDN, that means the process of obtaining Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate will fail. To fix it, install `python-certbot-dns-cloudflare` package:

```bash
$ sudo apt install certbot python-certbot-dns-cloudflare
```

Read instructions [here how to get Cloudflare API Token and obtain certificates](https://certbot-dns-cloudflare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). In short,

**1)** Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens and [get your API Token](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200167836-Where-do-I-find-my-Cloudflare-API-key-).

**2)** Create on the server `~/.secrets/certbot/` directory with `cloudflare.ini` file inside:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.secrets/certbot/
$ chmod 0700 ~/.secrets/
$ touch ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini
$ chmod 0400 ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini
```

**3)** Put inside `cloudflare.ini` file your Cloudflare token:

```bash
$ sudo nano ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini
```

```bash
# ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini

# Cloudflare API token (example) used by Certbot:
dns_cloudflare_api_token = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

**4)** Obtain certificates for all your domains declared in `procsd.yml` using _certbot-dns-cloudflare_ plugin:

```bash
# Example command for my-domain.com domain:

$ sudo certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini -d my-domain.com
```

**5)** If all went fine, update Nginx application config with new certificates (using certbot command). To get required certbot command type `$ procsd config certbot_command`, then execute it:

```bash
# Example command for my-domain.com domain:

$ sudo certbot --agree-tos --no-eff-email --redirect --non-interactive --nginx -d my-domain.com --register-unsafely-without-email
```

All is done!

## Difference with Foreman

[Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) itself designed for _development_ (not production) usage only and doing it great. Yes, Foreman allows to [export](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/#EXPORTING) Procfile to the Systemd, but that's all. After export you have to manually use `systemctl` and `journalctl` to manage/check exported services. Procsd not only exports application, but provides [simple commands](#all-available-commands) to manage exported target.

* Foreman systemd export uses [dymamic](https://fedoramagazine.org/systemd-template-unit-files/) services templates and as a result generates quite a lot of files/folders in the systemd directory even for a simple application.

* Services generated using Foreman contain [$PORT variable](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/#PROCFILE) in their names (and it's [undocumented](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/#SYSTEMD-EXPORT) logic). For example for Procfile and formation `web=1,worker=2` (from example above), exported services with Foreman will be: `sample_app-web@2500.service`, `sample_app-worker@2600.service` and `sample_app-worker@2601.service`. My opinion about this approach: it's complicated. Why is there required PORT variable in the services names? Procsd following one rule: simplicity. For export it uses static service files (that means for each process will be generated it's own service file) and services names have predictable, Heroku-like names.

* Procsd export can provide additional stop/restart commands for each service (see _Notes_ below).

* To delete existing app services from Systemd, there is `procsd destroy` command. It is doing the following: stop services if they are running, delete all required systemd files from systemd directory, and restart systemd (`daemon-reload`). This command especially useful while testing, when you need frequently create/update configuration.


## Notes

* If you want to set environment variables per process, [use format](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman/wiki/Per-Process-Environment-Variables) like Foreman recommends.

* To print commands before execution, provide env variable `VERBOSE=true` before procsd command. Example:

```
deploy@server:~/sample_app$ VERBOSE=true procsd logs -n 3

Execute: journalctl --no-pager --no-hostname --all --output short-iso -n 3 --unit sample_app-*

```

* You can use extended format of processes commands inside `procsd.yml` to provide additional restart/stop commands for each process:

> All possible options: [ExecStart](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#ExecStart=) (default command to start a process), [ExecReload](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#ExecReload=), and [ExecStop](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#ExecStop=).

> If procsd.yml has `processes:` option defined, then content of Procfile (if it exists) will be ignored.

```yml
app: sample_app
processes:
  web:
    ExecStart: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
    ExecReload: bundle exec pumactl phased-restart
  worker: bundle exec sidekiq -e production
```

Why? For example default Ruby on Rails application server [Puma](http://puma.io/) supports [Phased or Rolling restart](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/restart.md#normal-vs-hot-vs-phased-restart) feature. If you provide separate `ExecReload`command for a process, then this command will be called while executing `$ procsd restart` by systemd instead of just killing and starting process again.

* Another option you can provide for each process is [RuntimeMaxSec](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#RuntimeMaxSec=). It is used to automatically restart a process every N period of time. Could be useful for worker types of processes (like Sidekiq) where process memory could increase while running:

> Example values for RuntimeMaxSec: `30s` (30 seconds), `5m` (5 minutes), `3h` (3 hours), `1d` (1 day).

```yml
app: sample_app
processes:
  web:
    ExecStart: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
    RuntimeMaxSec: 12h
```

* If you use Nginx integration but default Nginx requests timeout (60s) is too small for you, [you can set a custom timeout](https://serverfault.com/a/777753) in the global Nginx config.


## Capistrano integration

https://github.com/vifreefly/capistrano-procsd


## ToDo
* Add `procsd update` command to quickly update changed configuration (application units, nginx config, etc), instead of calling two separate commands (`procsd destroy` and `procsd create`)
